## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup with proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- CSS Flexbox for layout structure
- Mobile-first workflow with responsive media queries
- CSS gradients and transitions for visual effects
- Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic functionality
- Data attributes to store pricing information

### Key learnings

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Creating a fully accessible toggle switch with proper ARIA attributes (role="switch", aria-label, focus states)
- Effectively using `data-*` attributes to store pricing information and dynamically update the UI
- Selecting elements and updating content dynamically based on user interactions
- Tracking and updating UI state based on user interactions with the billing toggle
